<h2>Modal Logic Blog Post / Final Project</h2>

<pre>
Planning:
    Why do we use modal logic?
    What is modal logic
    modal the mode of a operation of a word
    logic tools for resing about the world

    modal logic - probably more verbosely modal propositional logic considers the mode

    its basical propasitional logic of sentances or statment
    the sky is blue. is this true.

    truth is a funny thing its dependant on the scope or aspects you consider and becuse we
    are human we have differing asspects to consider.  For the most part we try and find the ground truths.

    The conculsions that are evedent once all the facts are considered.

    We might stat by looking up on a sunny day saying yeah the sky is blue. And calling our statement true.

    the problem with that is that when the sun goes down its red and fades to black. What is this I though the sky was blue!

    The problem is the sky's color is conditional on the time and place so considering that we might say
    the sky is blue when it is day time. But what about clouds... And so on we get more specific
    until we give up and throw our hands in the are and say well its sometimes blue and sometimes not and
    it depends on the whether which we cannot predict. so the sky is possibly blue. ( <>The sky is blue ).

    And that is modal logic. The Base system is necessarily = [] and possibly = <>



    the sky is possibly blue,
    the sky is mot necessarily not blue
    the sky is not necessarily blue

    <>p => ~[]~p
    And
    <>p => ~[]p

    So what is Modal Logic?

<h3>Introduction</h3>
First we may look at what we mean by <i>modal</i>
<blockquote>
    "A modal is an expression (like ‘necessarily’ or ‘possibly’) that is used to qualify the truth of a judgement."
    ~ <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/#ModLog">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>
    <button href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/" class="popup_iframe" name="Modal-Logic">View</button>
</blockquote>
I think the important idea is that we are trying to qualify the truth this
More generally in english modal is a little more generic.
<blockquote>
    "Think of modal as relating to some "mode," or form. A modal verb is a helper that gives additional information
    about the verb that follows it, and includes such words as "can," "will," "should," and "may," among others."
    ~ <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/modal">Vocabulary.com</a>
    <button href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/modal" class="popup_iframe" name="Modal">View</button>
</blockquote>


But we can see how it the term could relate to Logic

<blockquote>
    "<b>noun</b>
    <ol>
        <li> The science that investigates the principles governing correct or reliable inference.
        <li> A particular method of reasoning or argumentation: <small> We were unable to follow his logic.</small>
        <li>The system or principles of reasoning applicable to any branch of knowledge or study.
        <li> Reason or sound judgment, as in utterances or actions: <small>There wasn't much logic in her move.</small>
        <li> Convincing forcefulness; inexorable truth or persuasiveness:<small> the irresistible logic of the
            facts.</small>
    </ol>

The topic of provability seems interesting I may do my project on that do some research and explain in a blog post style
What that is

If I add missing topics to my cheat cheat it may be useful as resource


<blockquote>"<b>1. The history of provability logic</b><br>

    Two strands of research have led to the birth of provability logic. The first one stems from a paper by K. Gödel
    (1933), where he introduces translations from intuitionistic propositional logic into modal logic (more precisely,
    into the system nowadays called S4), and briefly mentions that provability can be viewed as a modal operator. Even
    earlier, C.I. Lewis started the modern study of modal logic by introducing strict implication as a kind of
    deducibility, where he may have meant deducibility in a formal system like Principia Mathematica, but this is not
    clear from his writings.

    The other strand starts from research in meta-mathematics: what can mathematical theories say about themselves by
    The other strand starts from research in meta-mathematics: what can mathematical theories say about themselves by
    encoding interesting properties?
